# 🌆 Urban Heat Island (UHI) Predictive Analysis 

A lightweight, containerized machine learning dashboard to analyze and predict Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects using greening effort simulations and clustering — powered by Scikit-learn and Streamlit.

---

##  Features

-  Predict neighborhood-level UHI intensity (temperature anomaly)
-  What-If Simulation: Adjust green cover and analyze the impact
-  ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP
-  Clustering: Identify similar neighborhoods based on heat and greenery
-  Interactive dashboard with real-time input (via Streamlit)
